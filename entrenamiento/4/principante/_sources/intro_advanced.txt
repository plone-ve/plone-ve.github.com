Who are we

...


Who are you?
------------

Tell us about yourselves:

* Name, company, country...
* What is your Plone experience?
* What is your web-development experience?
* What are your expectations for this training?
* I count to three. At three please shout out the name of your favorite text editor!
* Do you know the html of the output of this?

    .. code-block:: html

        <div class="hiddenStructure"
             tal:repeat="something python:[2, 4, 8][:-1]"
             tal:omit-tag="">
          <p tal:replace="something" />
        </div>

    .. only:: not presentation

        The answer is::

            2 4

* Do you know what the following would return?::

    [(i.Title, i.getURL()) for i in context.getFolderContents()]

    .. only:: not presentation

        If the current context is a folder this will return a list of tuples
        containing the title and url for each item within the folder.

What to expect
--------------

At the end of the first two days of training, you'll know many of the tools required for Plone installation, integration and configuration. You'll be able to install add-on packages and will know something about the technologies underlying Plone and their histories. You'll be ready to extend your skills via reading books like Practical Plone <http://www.packtpub.com/practical-plone-3-beginners-guide-to-building-powerful-websites/book>`_ and the `Plone documentation <http://docs.plone.org>`_.

At the end of the second two days, you won't be a complete professional Plone-programmer, but you will know some of the more powerful features of Plone and should be able to construct a more complex website with custom themes and packages. You should also be able to find out where to look for instructions to do tasks we did not cover. You will know most of the core-technologies involved in Plone-programming.

If you want to become a professional Plone-developer or a highly sophisticated Plone-integrator you should definitely read `Martin Aspeli's book <http://www.packtpub.com/professional-plone-4-development/book>`_ and then re-read it again while actually doing a complex project.

Most importantly you should practice your skills and not stop here but go forward! One recommended way would be to follow the `todo-app <http://tutorialtodoapp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
